# The Open Source Club

## Definition

<em>Open source</em> : social movement, begun by computer programmers, that rejects secrecy and centralized control of creative work in favour of decentralization, transparency, and unrestricted (“open”) sharing of information. Source refers to the human-readable source code of computer programs, as opposed to the compiled computer programming language instructions, or object code, that run on computers but cannot be easily understood or modified by people.

## Aim of the club

- [Starting an Open Source Project](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/)
- Learn to access and use ressources that are not found by search engines (a-z, O'Reilly Video Courses, ...)
- Hands-on experience with open-source software and open-source hardware
- Assist your school community 
  - by creating webpages in Github Pages
  - Jupyter Lab notebooks to analyse scientific data (collected in experiments)
- Historical view of Open Source Software ( [source](https://digitalcommons.lib.uconn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&context=libr_pubs) )
- Hands-on experience with Linux
- Learn to find and use databases (data.public.lu, ...) 
- Give people the choice to be consumers of information, and not become products of companies (tracking data and behaviour of people can be avoided)

## Quotes

> "Information flow is what the Internet is about. Information sharing is power. If you don't share your ideas, smart people can't do anything about them, and you'll remain anonymous and powerless."
<br>
Vint Cerf, ‘Father of the Internet’


> "I often compare open source to science. Science took this whole notion of developing ideas in the open and improving on other peoples' ideas. It made science what it is today and made the incredible advances that we have had possible. And I compare that to witchcraft and alchemy, where openness was something you didn't do."
<br>
Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux and Git


> "Proprietary software is an injustice. Sharing is good, and with digital technology, sharing is easy."
<br>
Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation


> "The intellectual property situation is bad and getting worse. To be a programmer, it requires that you understand as much law as you do technology."
<br>
Eric Allman, Sendmail founder


> "When we have welcoming communities of contributors, open source software gets better and more useful to everyone."
<br>
Limor Fried, electrical engineer and inventor, founder of Adafruit


> "Open source is about collaborating; not competing."
<br>
Kelsey Hightower, technologist at Google and open-source advocate


> "We believe open source is a public good and across every industry, we have a responsibility to come together to improve and support the security of open-source software we all depend on."
<br>
Jim Zemlin, executive director at The Linux Foundation


> "I didn’t intend to stay in tech when I got into it, but the people are what really kept me here. In this career, you get to continue working with the same people in different ways. In open source, you get to work with your competitors. I have friendly relationships with people who work at companies that are our technical competitors, and that’s normal. That’s the way this industry is supposed to work."
<br>
Rikki Endsley, Senior open source community marketing at AWS


> "Open source is a thankless job. We do it anyway."
<br>
Scott Hanselman, Principal Community Architect for Web Platform and Tools at Microsoft


> "Why does Amazon care about open source? At Amazon, we are customer-obsessed. Our customers love open source and want us to help them innovate on top of them. That is what drives our contribution to open source."
<br>
Arun Gupta, Principal Open Source Technologist at Amazon Web Services


> "A portfolio comprising contributions to free and open-source software contributions avoids the legal, moral, and reputational risks of sharing samples from proprietary work-for-hire creations."
<br>
Vicky Brasseur, author and open-source advocate


> "In real open source, you have the right to control your own destiny."
<br>
Linus Torvalds


> "Empowerment of individuals is a key part of what makes open source work, since in the end, innovations tend to come from small groups, not from large, structured efforts." 
<br>
Tim O'Reilly



> "Open source production has shown us that world-class software, like Linux and Mozilla, can be created with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firm nor the incentives of the marketplace as we've known them."
<br>
Howard Rheingold



> "In open source, we feel strongly that to really do something well, you have to get a lot of people involved."
<br>
Linus Torvalds



> "If you want to build an open source project, you can't let your ego stand in the way. You can't rewrite everybody's patches, you can't second-guess everybody, and you have to give people equal control."
<br>
Rasmus Lerdorf



> "There were open source projects and free software before Linux was there. Linux in many ways is one of the more visible and one of the bigger technical projects in this area, and it changed how people looked at it because Linux took both the practical and ideological approach."
<br>
Linus Torvalds
